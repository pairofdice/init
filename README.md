With limited broadcast, an IP address is given as a destination. This IP address is always 255.255.255.255

Technically, this broadcast should be sent to all the IP addresses that exist. However, it actually serves as an address for the broadcast within the network. This destination is always in its own network and can therefore be implemented in an Ethernet broadcast. A router does not forward such a packet.
