# 15. Find the command that kills the background commandâ€™s process


# The pgrep command finds processes by name and returns the PID for each match
# pkill is one of the commands that can directly kill a background process, using the process name.
# we can kill by the job ID:
# jobs
# kill %1    --- 1 being the job id
# the killall command takes the name and, kills all processes with that name.
# fg is a command used to bring a background process to the foreground. Then, we can simply stop the process by using Ctrl+C
